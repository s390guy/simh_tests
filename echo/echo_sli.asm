         TITLE 'ECHO - CONSOLE ECHO TEST'
* Program Description:
*
* ECHO is a bare-metal program.  It requires input/output commands to
* the system's console device.  It's purpose is to exercise the console
* device.  
*
* The program is executed by means of an IPL from a card deck. Initially
* a line is diplayed explaining the use of the program.  Following this
* a prompt is displayed with the keyboard unlocked for user input.
* Whatever is typed is then printed on the next line.  This is followed by the
* prompt with user input expected until the user enters 'quit' in lower case.
* without quotes.  quit terminates the program normally.
*
* The system interrupt key or console 'cancel' key will interrupt the
* executing program.  Display a message.  And then return to the normal
* echo functions described above.
*
* Target Platform: SimH
* Target Architecture: S/360
*
* This is a special test version that uses SLI in write CCW's to debug
* a console condition.
*
* Devices Used:
*   01F - Console device
