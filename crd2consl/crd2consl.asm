         TITLE 'CRD2CONSL - SEND CARD CONTENTS TO CONSOLE'
* Program Description:
*
* CRD2CONSL is a bare-metal program.  It requires input/output commands to
* the IPL card stream to read a card's contents and then send the card's
* contents to the consolde device.
*
* The program is executed by means of an IPL from a card deck containing as
* the last card the one that is sent to the console.  The card contains
* EBCDIC data and is part of the IPL deck.
*
* Target Architecture: S/360
*
* Devices Used:
*   00C - IPL card reader
*   01F - Console device
*
* Program Register Usage:
*
*   R0   Base register for access to the ASA.  Required by DSECT usage
*   R1   Device Channel and Unit Address for I/O instructions
*   R11  Contains zero for STATUS clearing (zero from CPU reset).
*   R12  The program base register
*   R15  Subroutine return register
*
* Disabled Wait State PSW's address field values used by the program:
*    X'000000' - Successful execution of the program
*    X'000008' - Unexpected Restart interruption occurred. Old Restart PSW at
*                address X'8'
*    X'000018' - Unexpected External interruption occurred.  Old External PSW at
*                address X'18'
*    X'000020' - Unexpected Supervisor interruption occurred.  Old Supervisor
*                PSW at address X'20'
*    X'000028' - Unexpected Program interruption occurred. Old Program PSW at
*                address X'28'
*    X'000030' - Unexpected Machine Check interruption occurred.  Old Machine
*                Check PSW at address X'30'
*    X'000038' - Unexpected Input/Output interruption occurred.  Old Input/Output
*                PSW at address X'38'
*    X'010004' - Console Device X'01F' or channel not operational
*    X'010008' - Console Device X'01F' or channel busy
*    X'01000C' - Console Device X'01F' or channel had a problem. See CSW.
*    X'010010' - Unexpected interruption from some other device. See ASA X'BA'
*    X'010014' - Console channel error occurred
*    X'010018' - Console device did not complete the I/O without a problem
*    X'020004' - Reader Device X'00C' or channel not operational
*    X'020008' - Reader Device X'00C' or channel busy
*    X'02000C' - Reader Device X'00C' or channel had a problem. See CSW.
*    X'020010' - Not used
*    X'020014' - Reader channel error occurred
*    X'020018' - Reader device did not complete the I/O without a problem

* Ensure interrupt traps are loaded by iplasma.py before program execution
* begins.  This macro will create the memory region that will also contain
* the IPL PSW.  The region name defaults to ASAREGN.  iplasma.py knows how
* to deal with this situation.
